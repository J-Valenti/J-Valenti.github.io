                        The 150th Annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show took 
                        place 
                        from January 31 to February 3, 2026, in New York City, 
                        featuring over 3,000 top-winning dogs. The prestigious 
                        event held competitions at the Jacob K. Javits 
                        Convention 
                        Center and Madison Square Garden.

                        The Westminster Kennel Club, established in 1877, is 
                        America’s oldest organization dedicated to the sport of 
                        dogs. It hosts the iconic, all-breed Westminster Kennel 
                        Club Dog Show, the second-longest, continuously held 
                        sporting event in the U.S., and since 1948, the longest 
                        nationally televised live dog show.

                        Week with its nearly 3,000 dogs from the U.S. and around
                        the world a pinnacle experience for any dog lover.

                        The winner was "Penny," a 4-year-old Doberman Pinscher 
                        (GCHP CH Connquest Best Of Both Worlds), marking the 
                        fifth Doberman victory in the show's 150-year history 
                        and the first since 1989. What a great way to ring in 
                        the new year for the world and for this breed!

                        “It’s been a long time, 37 years,” says Linton, who last
                        won the group with a Doberman Pinscher named “Indy.” “I
                        think it was ’89 when we won with Indy, and to be here 
                        at 
                        the 150th Westminster Dog show is just incredible.” 
                        Penny bested the other 32 dogs in the group to move on 
                        to Best in Show.
